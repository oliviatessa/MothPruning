# MothPruning
Originally inspired by biological nervous systems, deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful computational tools for modeling complex systems. DNNs are used in a diversity of domains and have helped solve some of the most intractable problems in physics, biology, and computer science. Despite their prevalence, the use of DNNs as a modeling tool comes with some major downsides. DNNs are highly overparameterized, which often results in them being difficult to generalize and interpret, as well as being incredibly computationally expensive. Unlike DNNs, which are often trained until they reach the highest accuracy possible, biological networks have to balance performance with robustness to a noisy and dynamic environment. Biological neural systems use a variety of mechanisms to promote specialized and efficient pathways capable of performing complex tasks in the presence of noise. One such mechanism, synaptic pruning, plays a significant role in refining task-specific behaviors. Synaptic pruning results in a more sparsely connected network that can still perform complex cognitive and motor tasks. Here, we draw inspiration from biology and use DNNs and the method of neural network pruning to find a sparse computational model for controlling a biological motor task.
